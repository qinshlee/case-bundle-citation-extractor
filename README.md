# Case Bundle Citation Extractor

## About
This is a personal project for myself to develop a text-based web application, with a focus on parsing and eventually NLP. There are probably better apps out there for this purpose.

## Problem statement
When submitting case bundles to court, lawyers are required to extract certain metadata from their bundles, including citations of statutes. It is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming to have to search, consolidate, copy and paste without much mistakes, especially when fatigue sets in after weeks or preparation.

## Objective
An application that allows users to extract citations of statutes from case bundles with one click, and with 90% accuracy (at least 9 out of 10 times)

## Learning objective
1. Master regex.
2. Practise how to develop apps iteratively.
3. (Stretch) Apply more advanced NLP methods.
